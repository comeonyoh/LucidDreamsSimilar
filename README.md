# LucidDreamsSimilar
Let's make a project similar to the LucidDreams introduced at Apple developer

## Motivation
After I watched the session [Protocol and Value Oriented Programming in UIKit Apps
](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/419/), I downloaded it's [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/LucidDreams/Introduction/Intro.html).\
But It was not working anymore. It was out of date. So I tried to convert it as to Swift5.


## What is similar
Have you heard about the Biosimilar?\
The biosmimilar is not a copy cat, but make the medicine more cheap and effectively.

So I want to make the Apple's code similar.\
Out of codes and API are converted as a new ones.\
Also there were some bugs which make crash the app. so I fixed it.


P.S\
In korea, there are big biosimilar companies and famous.
[Celltrion](https://www.celltrion.com), [Samsung Biologics](https://samsungbiologics.com).\
Let's find how much they are in the stock market. it's interesting.
